    "text": "It's a pleasure to see you here, my name is Thyago and I currently have a degree in computer engineering. I am a Backend Developer in PHP/Laravel and Java/Spring Boot, with experience in developing web systems. I have been working as a developer since 2022, I have always been very fond of technology and everything it can offer us. Currently, I work as a mid-level developer at Codernex. Already graduated as an engineer, I am now looking to improve myself in areas such as software architecture and technical leadership. Since the beginning of my career, I have participated in several national and international projects that had around 300 simultaneous users, acquiring knowledge in areas such as devops and cloud computing. Even so, I try to take a break in life and enjoy nature. My favorite hobby is swimming in the sea."
